# A-Tutorial-for-Reinforcement-Learning
The programming is to implement two basic algorithms —— R-SMART and Q-Learning<br>

If you want to know more about it, you can see [A Tutorial for Reinforcement Learning](https://web.mst.edu/~gosavia/tutorial.pdf), and you can also read [Target-sensitive control of Markov and semi-Markov processes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12555-011-0515-6). There are lots of details in this paper.
