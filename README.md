# A-Tutorial-for-Reinforcement-Learning
The programming is to implement two basic algorithms —— R-SMART and Q-Learning<br>

If you want to know more about it, you can see [A Tutorial for Reinforcement Learning](https://web.mst.edu/~gosavia/tutorial.pdf). And if you want to know more details about `R-SMART` algorithm, you can read [Target-sensitive control of Markov and semi-Markov processes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12555-011-0515-6). And for `Q-Learning` algorithm, you could read [Learning From Delayed Rewards](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/~chrisw/new_thesis.pdf).
